Image Segmentation and Visualization
This repository contains code for performing image segmentation and visualizing the segmented regions using Python and the scikit-image library. 
Image segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments to simplify its representation and extract meaningful information. 
The code provided demonstrates the use of the Felzenszwalb segmentation algorithm for segmenting an input image and visualizing the resulting segments.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
scikit-image
matplotlib

Usage
Clone the repository or download the code files.
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
arduino

pip install scikit-image matplotlib

Set the image_path variable in the code to the path of your input image.
Adjust the segmentation parameters (scale, sigma, and size_threshold) according to your requirements.
Run the script and the segmented image with visualizations will be displayed.

Description
The code performs the following steps:

Loads the input image using the specified image_path.
Applies the Felzenszwalb segmentation algorithm to the image using the felzenszwalb() function from the scikit-image library.
Merges smaller segments whose area is below the size_threshold parameter.
Generates a boundary overlay image using the mark_boundaries() function to visualize the segment boundaries.
Creates a color overlay image using the label2rgb() function to visualize the segmented regions with different colors.
Calculates the total number of segments generated using the regionprops() function.
Displays the original image, segmented image using a jet colormap, segmented image with color overlay, and the boundary overlay image using matplotlib.
